This project used python to transform the [JHU Covid-19 dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).

We performed the following analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Shafquat/COVID-19_day_count/blob/master/Merge_Data_add_Day_Count.ipynb):
* Consolidated the daily files
* Editted the data quality for different spellings of the same country
* Grouped the data by country
* Calculated Active Cases
* Calculated Daily occurences of Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries
* Added in news events in a separate table

The goal is to discover trends and analyze the data to identify which countries are effectively tackling the Covid-19 crisis.
